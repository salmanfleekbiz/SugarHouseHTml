			<h4>When will my blank banner order be shipped?</h4>
			<p>
				Nearly all blank banner orders will ship the same day when ordered before 2:00pm Eastern Time, Monday-Friday. Orders placed after 2:00pm will ship the next business day. The only exception would be on extraordinarily large banners or quantities, or if we are temporarily out of a certain fabric. We will contact you if there is ever a problem getting your order shipped according to these guidelines.
			</p>
			
			<h4>When will my printed banner order be shipped?</h4>
			<p>
				Finish times on custom printed banners is almost always 2-3 days from the order date. Delays in approving proofs will add to the finish time. Faster service is available; we can usually ship a printed banner the same day if it is ordered early in the day. There may be an additional fee for rush jobs, typically 20% of the cost of the banner.
			</p>
			
			
			<h4>How long can I expect my vinyl banner to last?</h4>
			<p>
				Vinyl banners are meant to serve as temporary signage, and come with no guarantees as to longevity. The life of a vinyl banner will depend greatly on how and where it is hung. A banner hung indoors will obviously last indefinitely. A banner hung outside, fastened securely against a brick wall, may last for several years. A banner stretched between two poles in a windy area may only last a day or two before it rips.
				<br />
				We use only high quality vinyls that we have tried and tested for years. While we can't guarantee how long your vinyl banner will last, we can promise you that you're getting a quality product that will serve you well.
			</p>
			
			
			<h4>What is the difference between a 'Cut Size' and 'Finish Size'?</h4>
			<p>
				A 'Cut Size' banner is made by cutting a length of fabric from the roll and hemming it. That means that the final width of the banner will be 2-3 inches narrower than the width of the roll. So a 3'x8' Cut Size banner will actually measure 33"x96" (cut size doesn't affect the length). Cut Size banners eliminate wasted fabric, and save you money.
				<br />
				<br />
				If you order a 3'x8' Finish Size banner, it will actually measure 36"x96" after it is hemmed. Finish size banners are made from a wider length of fabric and cut to size, creating some fabric waste. Finish size banners will often cost more, but not always (see next question).
	
			</p>
			
			
			<h4>Why do some 'Cut Size' banners cost the same as a 'Finish Size' banner?</h4>
			<p>
				A 'Cut Size' banner will only be less expensive if you order a banner the same width as the roll of fabric. For example, the 13 oz. white fabric comes in 24", 36", 48", 61", and 72" rolls. So if you order a 30"x96" banner, the price will be the same for a Cut Size or a Finish Size; either way, the 36" roll of fabric is used. However, if you order a 36"x96" banner, a Cut Size banner will be less expensive ($2.00/foot) than a Finish Size banner ($2.50/foot). For a list of all our fabrics and the widths of the rolls, 	
			</p>
			
			<h4>Why are some banner prices for 'even quantities only'?</h4>
			<p>
				Banners priced in 'even quantites only' are made by splitting a width of material in half to make two banners. For example, 10 oz. Fluorescent Green fabric comes in 72" rolls. If one 30" x 96" banner is ordered, a full width of fabric must be used, so the banner is priced accordingly ($3.50/foot). However, if two 30" x 96" banners are ordered, both can be made from one width of fabric, so the 'even quantity' discount would apply ($2.35/foot). Whenever an odd quantity is ordered, the odd banner will be priced using the full width of fabric.
	
			</p>
			
			<h4>What other types of banner fabrics are available?</h4>
			<p>
				We can make banners out of several other types of fabrics not available online. We have flag nylon available in several colors, as well as natural canvas, acrylic fabrics (Sunbrella), super smooth vinyls, mesh fabrics, and backlit fabrics. We also offer digitally printed fabric banners on poplin, dacron, and satin.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Height vs. Length - Does it matter?

			</h4>
			<p>
				Normally, the height and length of a blank banner can be interchanged without any problem. We usually talk of size with the height first, and then the length. So a 3' x 8' banner would be 3' tall and 8' long, whereas an 8' x 3' banner would be 8' tall and 3' long. <br />
Times that it will make a difference are when you add pockets, webbing, rope, etc. to one dimension. If you order a 3x8 banner with pockets on the top and bottom, you'll get 8' long pockets. But if you order an 8x3 banner with pockets on the top and bottom, you'll get 3' long pockets. <br />
There will be times when ordering banners on the website that it might make a difference in price. If you're not sure, you can enter the dimensions both ways and see if the price is the same for both.

			<h4>
				How do I get a Promotional Code?

			</h4>
			<p>

				Where do I enter my Promotional Code?

			</h4>
			<p>
				The box to enter Promotional Codes is located in your shopping cart upon checkout. The box will only display after you have started the checkout process and registered, or entered your User Id and Password.

			</p>

				Do you offer discounts for large quantities?

			</h4>

					6-14: 10% Discount
