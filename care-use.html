			<h4> Banner Care & Installation Instructions</h4>
			<p>
				 The following instructions will help insure that you clean, store, and install your banner properly. Failure to follow these instructions may result in a shorter banner lifespan.
			</p>
			<h4>Cleaning </h4>
			<p>
				 Banner vinyl is made of a woven mesh scrim that has been laminated or coated with vinyl. The vinyl has been treated with UV and mildew resistant coatings that help to ensure a longer banner life. The graphics on the banner have been printed with solvent based, pigmented inks and may have been laminated (upon request) which can protect the ink against UV rays, chemicals, and abrasion. All banners should be cleaned with simple soap and water and a soft cloth or sponge. Never use a solvent based cleaner. Cleaners with a solvent base may damage the vinyl and remove the ink. If necessary, a soft brush may also be used, but be careful to scrub gently so as not to scratch off the ink. 
			</p>
			
			<h4>Storing</h4>
			<p>
				 Always make sure the banner is completely dry before storing. Your banner should be loosely rolled with the print side facing in. If possible your banner should be rolled onto a rigid core or tube of some kind to ensure that it does not kink, crease, or smash while being transported or stored. Never fold or crease the banner as these crease and fold lines may be difficult and time consuming to remove. Never allow the banner to have ink to ink contact with itself or any other type of print or paint. If the banner is able to touch ink to ink, it may stick and transfer or remove ink. Store banners in a cool, dry location.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Installing</h4>
			<p>
				 The most common way for banners to become ruined is through improper installation. A loose vinyl banner can quickly become destroyed in even mildly windy conditions. If part or all of the banner comes loose and is free to flap in the wind, the vinyl may start to crack and break apart, flaking off of the banner. This will damage the structural integrity of the banner as well as the printed image, usually resulting in a ruined banner. Banners that are installed properly can usually be left up year-round, although special consideration should be taken in extremely windy conditions. Banner installation methods vary, but here are two that we find most common:
				 <br />
				 <br />
				 1. The ideal way to install a banner is against a hard and flat surface. Make use of all the grommets to make sure that the banner is held securely in place (screws and washers are often used in this method to hold the banner against the flat, rigid surface). This method is recommended as it provides the most secure installation and increases longevity.
				 <br />
				 <br />
				2. Another common installation method is to hang a banner between two rigid structures such as poles or trees. The ideal way to accomplish this method is to order the banner with ropes sewn through the hems on the top and bottom of the banner. These ropes are then attached to the mouting points (poles, trees, etc.). This transfers the stress from the vinyl banner to the more durable rope, which will increase the longevity of the banner. If your banner does not have ropes sewn through the hems, we suggest weaving a rope in and out of the grommets along the top and bottom so that the rope is not just tied to the corner grommets but is a continuous piece that passes through several grommets on the banner. Tying rope to the corner grommets alone often results in the corner grommets being ripped out as the banner is not designed for this type of installation.
				<br />
				<br />
				Regardless of how your banner is installed, always be sure that whatever it is being secured to is able to support the banner in windy and non-windy conditions. Remember when installing a banner you are essentially putting up a “sail” and depending on the size of your banner this “sail” may catch a lot of wind. We recommend that banners be taken down in extreme winds to avoid damaging banner or the mounting location.


			</p>
			
			<h4> Wind Holes</h4>
			<p>
				 We do not recommend adding wind holes or wind slits to your banner. Wind holes are often seen in vinyl banners which are being installed between to poles or trees. In theory these wind slits allow air to pass through the banner, reducing the stress on the banner. In reality, wind tunnel studies have shown that wind holes do very little in reducing wind stress. In some tests, the wind slits were shown to actually have a negative effect on the longevity of a banner. Theories suggest that by cutting wind holes, the integrity of the banner is compromised and possible tear-points are created where the holes start and stop. In most cases a properly reinforced and installed banner without wind slits will last just as long or longer than a banner with wind slits.
